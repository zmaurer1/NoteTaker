# NoteTaker
I created a server.js file for the routes and api and html routes files. I also created a store.js file with the read, get and add notes functions.

I am having trouble getting it to save the file to the notes. My tutor couldn't find any errors and the code looks right. I am also having trouble deploying Heroku.
